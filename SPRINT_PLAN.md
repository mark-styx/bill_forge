## Remaining Work (Pre-Launch)

### P0 - Must Fix Before Pilot
- [x] CI pipeline green on GitHub Actions
- [ ] End-to-end smoke test: upload → OCR → queue → approve → export
- [ ] Docker Compose full-stack startup (API + frontend + PostgreSQL + Redis)
- [ ] Seed data for demo/pilot environments
- [x] Environment variable documentation (`.env.example` complete)

### P1 - Should Have for Pilot
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation review
- [ ] Error handling audit (replace remaining `.unwrap()` in production paths)
- [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Production logging configuration (JSON structured logs)
- [ ] Basic monitoring alerts (Prometheus/Grafana configs exist)

### P2 - Nice to Have
- [ ] Test coverage improvement (target 80%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (OCR pipeline, API latency)
- [ ] Security audit (dependency scan, input sanitization)
- [ ] Onboarding playbook for pilot customers
