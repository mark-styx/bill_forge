## Remaining Work (Pre-Launch)

### P0 - Must Fix Before Pilot
- [x] CI pipeline green on GitHub Actions
- [x] End-to-end smoke test: upload → OCR → queue → approve → export (scripts/e2e_smoke_test.sh)
- [x] Docker Compose full-stack startup (API + frontend + PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO)
- [x] Seed data for demo/pilot environments (seed.rs with 5 pilot tenants)
- [x] Environment variable documentation (`.env.example` complete)

### P1 - Should Have for Pilot
- [x] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation review — 24 paths registered, 12 schemas, 9 tags, Swagger UI at /swagger-ui
- [x] Error handling audit — 24 `.unwrap()` calls in API crate audited, all safe (metrics registration, serde serialization, Response::builder)
- [x] Rate limiting on auth endpoints — per-IP token bucket (20 req/60s), returns 429 when exceeded
- [x] Production logging configuration — JSON structured logs in production, human-readable in dev
- [x] Basic monitoring alerts — Prometheus alerts wired (4 rule groups, 16 alerts), Grafana dashboard provisioned (11 panels)

### P2 - Nice to Have
- [ ] Test coverage improvement (target 80%)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (OCR pipeline, API latency)
- [ ] Security audit (dependency scan, input sanitization)
- [ ] Onboarding playbook for pilot customers
